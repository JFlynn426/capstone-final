This project was my capstone for SDG. I made an administration page that I could upload pictures from to an external image hosting service (cloudinary) that would categorize the pictures according to a predefined organization automatically through a C#/.NET backend. The image addresses, category information and picture information were stored in a postgreSQL database that was accessed through a C#/.NET RESTful API that populated a fully dynamic react front end. I entered SDG knowing that I wanted to make a site for my photography which I had been working on previous to entering the cohort and I am happy with the results. I plan on developing the site further for professional application.
